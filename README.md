class FullStackDeveloper:

    def __init__(self):
        self.first_name = "Akash"
        self.last_name = "Jadhav"
        self.role = "FullStack Developer"

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by, hope you find some of my work interesting.")


me = FullStackDeveloper()
me.say_hi()
